## Short description of what you attempted to build
Attempted to build a react-native application that has a location feature. 
Additionally, I tried to add graph visualization features to the application.

I followed this tutorial for the map location feature:

## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I did not work with a partner. I did all of this work on my own.
## What you learned

I learned how to access different types of maps on react native. Specifically, I learned how to use the Apple Map preset from the react native map library.

## What didnâ€™t work
