## Short description of what you attempted to build
Attempted to build a react-native application that has a location feature. 
Additionally, I tried to add graph visualization features to the application.

I followed this tutorial for the map location feature:
https://dev-yakuza.github.io/en/react-native/react-native-maps/

I also used this tutorial to figure out how to add tabs for navigation in my app:
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation/

For making graphs, I used this website as a reference:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg-charts


## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I did not work with a partner. I did all of this work on my own.

## What you learned

I learned how to access different types of maps on react native. Specifically, I learned how to use the Apple Map preset from the react native map library. Additionally, I learned how to add tab navigation to the bottom of my screen.

## What didnâ€™t work
