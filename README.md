## Short description of what you attempted to build
I attempted to build a simple react-native application that implements button clicks, page navigation, and a map feature. I also wanted to add a data visualization feature, so I decided to add a bar graph as one of the pages. I wanted to connect the visualization feature to the coordinates from the map page, but I was unable to figure that out. 

I followed this tutorial for the map location feature:
https://dev-yakuza.github.io/en/react-native/react-native-maps/

I also used this tutorial to figure out how to add tabs for navigation in my app:
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation/

For making graphs, I used this website as a reference:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg-charts


## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I did not work with a partner. I did all of this work on my own.

## What you learned
I learned about react native and the basics of react native, such as the syntax and the way code is supposed to be structured (i.e. components, classes, etc.). I learned how to access different types of maps on react native. Specifically, I learned how to use the Apple Map preset from the react native map library. I learned how to add a specific location and a label to a location marker. Additionally, I learned how to add tab navigation to the bottom of my screen for react native. Lastly, I learned how to use react-native svg charts to build a bar graph.

## What didnâ€™t work
I tried to add labels to my bar graph, but I could not get it to work. I also wanted to see if I could somehow connect the map feature with the graph, but I couldn't find anything to help me get a better sense of how to keep track of the location and then update this on the other screen.
